Dear Melody, 
I had never believed in love before I met you.
I only had the idea that something like love existed, but when I laid my eyes on you, I saw it coming alive.
You have made my soul come alive, and my heart couldnâ€™t stop loving you for a mere moment. 
I am utterly grateful to destiny for you and your love.
You are the sweetest thing in my life, and there is nothing else I would ever love as I love you. 
Thank you for being in my life and making me believe in true love. With you, I feel truly alive. 
I will love you till the day i die.
Your are the place my life begins and you will be where it ends. 
You make me fly without wings.
You make me fly without wings.
